This project refines the code from Project 1, facilitating critical section access using semaphores.

To run this program:

1. Download and extract the `.zip` file. 
2. In the command-line interface of your choice, navigate to the `CS3113-Project3` folder. This folder should contain `project3.c`.
3. Enter the command `gcc project3.c -o project3`. This will compile `project3.c` and generate the executable file as `project3`.
4. Finally, run the executable file by entering the command `./project3`.
